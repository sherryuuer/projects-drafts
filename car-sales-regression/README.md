# Car sales regression Machine Learning Project README

## Project Overview

This machine learning project aims to predict the price of cars based on various features such as make, color, odometer reading, and the number of doors. The dataset used for this project is named `car-sales.csv`.

### Dataset Information

The dataset contains the following columns:

- **Make**: The brand or manufacturer of the car.
- **Colour**: The color of the car.
- **Odometer (KM)**: The odometer reading in kilometers.
- **Doors**: The number of doors on the car.
- **Price**: The target variable representing the price of the car.

## Data Preprocessing

The preprocessing steps involved handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. This was achieved using the `Pipeline` class from the `sklearn` package.

## Model

The chosen machine learning model for this project is Ridge Regression. Ridge Regression is a linear regression model that includes L2 regularization. The regularization term helps prevent overfitting and can be tuned for optimal performance.

## Evaluation

While the model's performance may not be exceptional, this project serves as a valuable learning experience. The goal here is to understand the machine learning pipeline, data preprocessing, and the impact of different algorithms.

### Future Improvements

To enhance the model's performance, consider experimenting with different algorithms, tuning hyperparameters, and exploring additional feature engineering techniques.
