# Heart Disease Classification

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for a machine learning project focused on the classification of heart disease using the heart_disease dataset. The goal is to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify whether an individual is likely to have heart disease based on various input features.

## Dataset

The heart_disease dataset used in this project consists of a collection of features and relevant attributes. The target variable is binary, indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone myurl
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd heart-disease-classification
```

3. Install the required dependencies in conda:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook containing the main code:

```bash
jupyter notebook heart-disease.ipynb
```

2. Follow the instructions within the notebook or script to execute the machine learning pipeline.

## Model Training

The project uses a machine learning pipeline that includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. Various classification algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines, are explored to identify the most suitable model for heart disease classification.

## Evaluation Metrics

The performance of the models is assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to correctly classify instances of heart disease and non-heart disease.
